- free fit design, align by hand insufficient.
- annodizing could cause it to be too large.
- mechanism from a usual telescope.
- should be able to remove telescope assembly entirely. 
- current design uses thread which is ok, but tolerances are kind of big.

- hexagonal facets on vaccum chamber 
- attachment points to the rest of the chamber.
- consider machining requirements.
- intersection points of the ports.

-material is not easily magnetised.
-aluminum
216 LNS steel - ESA 1.4404 - not magnetic
-analytical solution is fine.
